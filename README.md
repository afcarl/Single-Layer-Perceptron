# Single-layer Perceptron

Proposed by [Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt "Rosenblatt"), it is the simplest Artificial Neural Network.

# Overview

This Jupyter Notebook shows step by step, the process of building a Single-layer Perceptron using Python to classify 2D points.

# Dependencies

- matplotlib
- numpy
- random

You can install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ "pip").

# Usage

1. Install the dependencies;
2. Run Jupyter Notebook in terminal to see the code in your browser.
